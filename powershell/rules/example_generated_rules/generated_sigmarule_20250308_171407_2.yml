title: Suspicious LSASS Access by Non-System Process
id: 3241c91b-8448-41d0-ad73-c9f1d9c62561
status: test
description: >
  Detects suspicious process access events where a non-system process attempts
  to access the LSASS executable. In these events the TargetImage ends with "lsass.exe",
  and a granted access value of "0x1010" is observed. Legitimate system processes are expected
  to reside under Windows directories, so processes originating outside of "C:\Windows" are flagged.
