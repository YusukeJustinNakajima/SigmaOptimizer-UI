# SigmaOptimizer-UI <br> ~ Automated Sigma Rule Generation and Optimization ~  

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview  
**SigmaOptimizer-UI** is a user-friendly interface built on top of [SigmaOptimizer](https://github.com/YusukeJustinNakajima/SigmaOptimizer), designed to make end-to-end Sigma rule generation and optimization more accessible and intuitive.
By combining log analysis, rule evaluation, and iterative refinement powered by LLM, it streamlines the entire workflowâ€”enabling seamless creation, testing, and tuning of Sigma rules without the need to directly interact with PowerShell scripts.

âœ… **Automated Sigma rule generation based on real-world logs**  
âœ… **Integration with [MITRE Caldera](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) (Î² version)**  
âœ… **Rule validation with syntax checks (Invoke-SigmaRuleTests)**  
âœ… **Detection rate measurement using [Hayabusa](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa)**  
âœ… **FP check of created rules using [evtx-baseline](https://github.com/NextronSystems/evtx-baseline)**  
âœ… **Command obfuscation support ([Invoke-ArgFuscator](https://github.com/wietze/Invoke-ArgFuscator)) for robust detection**

## ðŸš€ Usage  
### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites   
- **Windows environment** 
- **Run `AutoSetup.ps1` to automate the entire setup process. This script handles all the necessary preparations seamlessly. Before executing the script, update the `OPENAI_APIKEY` section in `AutoSetup.ps1` with your own API key.**
    - Installing Required PowerShell Modules
        - `Pester` (for running tests)  
        - `powershell-yaml` (for parsing YAML files)  
        - `Invoke-ArgFuscator` (for command obfuscation) 
    - Downloading and Setting Up Hayabusa
        - The script automatically downloads the latest Hayabusa release from GitHub.
    - Extracting the Archive
        - The script ensures the benign_evtx_logs/win10-client.tgz file is extracted
        - The default setting only checks false positives (FP) using the normal logs obtained in a **Windows 10 client environment.**
        - If needed, add your own logs according to your environment(or use [evtx-baseline](https://github.com/NextronSystems/evtx-baseline))
- **Recommended to configure the following two log sources to create better sigma rules:**
    - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational -> Sysmon installation
    - Security EventID:4688 -> https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing
