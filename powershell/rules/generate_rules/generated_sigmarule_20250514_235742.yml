title: Suspicious 'net user' Command Execution from Uncommon Directory
id: c5c97964-3e5c-4072-9389-688d353ff3bb
status: test
description: >
  This Sigma rule detects the execution of the Windows command interpreter (Cmd.Exe) with commandaï¿½?line arguments containing both "net user" and "/domain". Such use from a non-standard current directory (i.e. not under "C:\Windows" or "C:\Program Files") may indicate anomalous behavior used during lateral movement or network enumeration.
